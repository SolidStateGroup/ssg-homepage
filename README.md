## Storybook

This project uses storybook, you can run ```npm run storybook``` , this will render stories according to /stories/index.


## Creating pages

As with any standard nextjs project you need to add any pages to /pages/url.js. See https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/navigate-between-pages/using-link.

There's a standardised Page component which will add any seo meta tags necessary. Usage:

```$xslt
          <Page title={Constants.titles.partners} canonical="partners">
               <div>Content</div>
          </Page>
```


## Creating a blog

There is an automatic blog generator built into this project, any pages within /static/pages/blog-markdown will be parsed and the metadata inside will generate a blog.json.



```$xslt
         ---
         title: Achieving a perfect 100% Google Lighthouse audit score with Next and Redux
         published: true
         description: Jumping down a satisfying rabbit hole with NextJS
         tags: webdev, showdev, react, javascript

         <--- Markdown content here -->
```

Once you have created the post in the required folder you will need to create a route at blog/filename.js, within that you can create your markup, e.g.

```$xslt

import md from '../../static/pages-blog-markdown/100-percent-lighthouse-score.md';
import BlogPost from '../../components/BlogPost';


const BlogPostPage = props => (
    <BlogPost
      route={props.router.route}
      source={md}
    />
);

BlogPostPage.displayName = 'BlogPostPage';

export default BlogPostPage;

```
