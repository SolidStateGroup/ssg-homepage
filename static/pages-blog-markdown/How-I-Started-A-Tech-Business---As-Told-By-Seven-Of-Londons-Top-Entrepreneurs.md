We support startups. We wanted to shine a light on London’s ecosystem to show the tenacity, passion and journeys shown by a cross section. We interviewed 7 entrepreneurs, as diverse as can be in age, background, gender, career and startup industry, but with one thing in common, they all left a successful corporate career to found startups.

These corporate-leavers-turned-founders are [the demographic most likely to build successful businesses](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/a-study-of-27-million-startups-found-ideal-age-to-start-a-business-and-its-much-older-than-you-think.html) and grow the UK economy, so they’re deserving of the tech community’s support. 

We hope their war stories, journeys and nuggets of wisdom serve as a guide to aspiring entrepreneurs sat in blue chip offices, dreaming big ideas, and wondering how to start.

We’ve indexed the interviews into the categories of ex-profession, hard skills, personal challenges, and new startup industry.
