90% of digital transformation projects fail, but corporates are quickly learning from the startup ecosystem how they can digitally disrupt themselves, grow their business, and avoid costly failures. 

Corporates are now producing hackathons, accelerators, venture capital, intrapreneurs, and internal disruptors, and the employees who facilitate all that, the innovation managers, the CIOs, the analysts, the entrepreneurs-in-residence, are hungry for information straight from the developers’ mouths. This blog is for those people.

React Native is fast becoming to the go-to tool for startups building mobile apps, and as we’re covering tools to facilitate corporate innovation, we thought we’d share how we see React Native being used in intrapreneurship too.

We’re looking at how React Native has benefits throughout the innovation lifecycle:

- Ideation
- Visualisation/validation
- Feedback loop/stakeholder involvement

Then in our follow-up blogs, we’ve pulled together case studies, industry thought-leader opinions on React Native, trends for 2018, so you can see how the corporate world is already accelerating with React Native. We’re also going to look at how React Native works in scale-up situations, including how it can work with a suite of technologies for apps with millions of users.

### Ideation 

React Native is valued by startups who want to build MVPs and betas as quickly and easily as possible, and the same applies to ideation teams. <a href="/2018/02/05/2018/Glenfiddich-Stag-Racing-When-Whisky-Meets-Hackathons/" target="_blank">We ourselves use it in corporate hackathons</a> for apps as wide ranging as dating apps and VR racing games.

>Why Use React Native For Ideation - Speed.

The speed React Native can give a team comes from three areas: it’s easy to learn, it’s easy to find support, and most importantly of all, it’s cross-platform.

**Easy to learn** - React Native is essentially Javascript, and if you can’t get to grips with Javascript you’ve no business calling yourself a developer. It’s easy for mobile devs of either iOS or android to learn, and even for non-mobile devs too, as React Native is based on React for web applications.

The ease gives the added benefit that React Native devs are relatively plentiful, it shouldn’t be hard to put your RN team together. Corporate innovation often brings employees together from diverse silos from the wider business, but all the devs can be united by knowledge of React Native.

**Well supported** - React Native is open sourced by Facebook who’ve put a lot of work into it, but the real support will come from the community. **React Native has the fourth most starred repo on Github**, and there’s a good bet that most of the problems faced by your ideation team have been encountered by others before you.

The essence of startup speed is crowd-sourced plagiarism after all.

**Cross-platform** - To be fair, Java and Swift are well supported too, and simple enough for devs to learn to a useful degree, but React Native pulls ahead of the crowd like Usain Bolt on chicken nuggets when you remember that it’s cross platform. One codebase in React Native creates apps on both android and iOS, so you only need one developer or team to build the demo. If you do the simple 2 into 1 maths, you can see the speed benefit instantly.

>First and foremost the customer experience is the one that matters

Ideation is all about spotting opportunities, *then* coming up varied solution ideas, *then* testing them without prejudice. It’s only when Proofs of Concept reach customers for validation that an idea can cross from pie-in-the-sky to cornish-pasty-in-the-budget-supported-digital-transformation project. 

### Validation

This is the biggest divide between traditional corporate thinking and entrepreneurial instincts: startups are always in experiment mode. An MVP is therefore not entrepreneur-speak for "the most basic app that you can build", the MVP is the most basic solution which can *test a theory*. It's an experiment.

Therefore, basic solution does not mean basic customer experience. 

A corporate's beta app can have limited features, but it still needs to feel like a quality product in order to give a valid test result, otherwise you're left wondering if the users hate your idea, or just your shoddy MVP...

This is where React Native comes in.

React Native can easily cobble together UI components and libraries like mix and match ikea suites. Coming from React, its forte is smooth and modern UI. If you take the time to design it well, add branding, story, and a decent customer journey, you'll have an MVP you can trust.
