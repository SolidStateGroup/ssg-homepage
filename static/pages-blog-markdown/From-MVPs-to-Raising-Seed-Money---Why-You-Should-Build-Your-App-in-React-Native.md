You’re a startup founder, you know React Native is used to build mobile apps, but you’ve no idea if it can build *your* app, and how would you even know it was any good? This blog’s going to solve that.

Startups come to us at every stage of development, we’ve even spun out a couple ourselves, so we’ve put together our ~~learnings~~ mistakes, resources and tips for building apps in React Native so founders like you can build MVPs and raise money with the best app your limited resources can build.

### This guide is for startups at three main stages: 

1. You want to build an MVP
2. You want to build your first proper app based off your MVP
3. You’ve got some juicy funding and want to rebuild your first hash of an app now you can afford things like top devs and proper user testing.

So you’re going to want to know either:

1. WTF is React Native and why would I use it to build an MVP?
2. <a href="/2018/02/28/2018/How-Do-I-Use-A-React-Native-App-To-Raise-A-Seed-Round/" target="_blank">How do spend my dwindling resources on devs to build a performant RN app to win me some funding?</a>
3. <a href="/2018/02/27/2018/React-Native-For-Scale-Ups---Use-Cases-and-Future-Proofing/" target="_blank">How can I ensure that my current disaster of an app gets re-written and future-proofed for a scale-up with a reputation and investors to maintain?</a>

### First thing’s first, WTF is React Native?

We developers will tell you it’s a Javascript framework which is used to build a real mobile app that's indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C or Java. It runs in a background process directly on the end-device and communicates with the native platform via a serializable, asynchronous and batched Bridge.

Explain it like I’m five.

Instead of building an app for iOS and an app for android using two different languages and two different codebases and two difference teams and two different user journeys, you can use React Native to make real apps for both iOS and android with one language, one codebase, one team and one user journey. 

[For even more info, here’s our long read on WTF is React Native](https://www.solidstategroup.com/2017/02/08/2017/Its-cross-platform-and-massively-reduces-app-dev-costs-but-WTF-is-React-Native/)

But why would I use React Native for an MVP?

If you or your technical co-founder want to go beyond Wix/Squarespace and hack something together to test your core value, we recommend that you use React Native above Objective C or Java (iOS and android's usual languages for native apps).

React Native is open-sourced by Facebook, and very well supported by an enthusiastic community. Whether you’re learning Javascript (the popular language for React Native and web applications) from scratch, or pushing it to its limits, the beauty of React Native is that someone somewhere will have had the same problem you have, they'll have posted about it on forums, and had helpful replies with solutions. For newbies to RN, this is invaluable to help you educate yourself and build your MVP quickly and easily.

Furthermore, the contributions and repos on the likes of Github are veritable gold mines, you can cobble together components and libraries which other people have created with barely a line of code written by yourself. Our rule for MVPs is Do Not Code and [you should read this blog to understand why we developers are shouting that You Should Not Code](https://www.solidstategroup.com/2017/01/19/2017/5%20things%20most%20startups%20forget%20when%20building%20their%20first%20app/). However, by choosing React Native over the website template services such as Wix, you'll still be able to build mobile-first MVPs bespoke to your needs, without shoe-horning your grand idea into someone else's set template.

At the end of the day, you simply don’t have to reinvent the wheel when building an MVP, plagiarise someone else’s!
