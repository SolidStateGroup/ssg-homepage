When the likes of Walmart and Uber start using React Native for their apps, you pay attention. No longer does React Native serve only basic apps, no, this javascript framework is being used for everything from integrating old code with new, to re-writing hugely popular apps from scratch with 95% code shared between Android and iOS.

We've picked out an example for each kind of use case, so you can see whether your startup or digital transformation project could also ride the React Native rocket ship:

## Dugout FC:

Use Case: building a new app from scratch in 6 months

> "Because we chose React Native, we could use near-identical code for both platforms, reducing development time by almost half."

## UberEATS:

Use Case: building a mobile app based on a web demo
