title: Failing faster - Part 1

But what if it’s the wrong idea. At Solid State we’ve become obsessed with validating an idea first, before we get carried away, and it’s paying serious dividends.

<p>When an idea hits you it’s easy to become obsessed with it - leaping into prototypes, raising money, and moving forward as fast as possible  - all the things you’re ‘meant to do’. But what if it’s the wrong idea. At Solid State we’ve become obsessed with validating an idea first, before we get carried away, and it’s paying serious dividends.</p>
<p>It started with a recent post on Hacker News for HiOperator (YC S16) who had <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13072415"  target="_blank">launched customer support as a SaaS</a></p>

</div>
<p>This idea made sense to us because we’ve used web chat on multiple projects and know it can be a distraction for staff at all levels. We also liked the clear business model and the fact that it was generating cash from the start.</p>
<p>We wanted to test if offering to handle a company’s online chat requests (distinct from HiOperator who handle phone support too) would be a product worth developing - is this a business that’s very easy to grow? We decided to find out.</p>
<h2><a id="Learning_from_past_experiences_10"></a>Learning from past experiences</h2>
<p>From past startup experiences our team has seen the joy, and the dangers that exist in long theorising about an idea - then building wireframes, raising money, and basically doing everything that makes you feel like you are making tangible progress, whilst the core assumptions of the business can go unexamined. Time and money is easily wasted.</p>
<p>We asked ourselves what was the most aggressive way that we could validate demand for this service and decided that trying to immediately sell the idea to people currently using other chat services would be a good test.</p>
<h2><a id="Is_there_a_market_15"></a>Is there a market?</h2>
<p>Using Crunchbase, we filtered down for companies based in London and churned through them looking for those using online chat. When we found one, we immediately engaged them by email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hi, my name is Joshua. I see you are using Intercom for your chat. I work at a startup incubator in London and we are starting a company to handle live chat support requests for fast growing venture backed companies that want to drive conversion and customer satisfaction. You keep using your existing software and we answer your chats by having UK based chat agents answering chats based on your historical conversations. Does answering chat requests interrupt your workflow?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We contacted 51 startups and here are the results:</p>
<div class="row">

</div>
<p>Of the 51 startups:</p>
<ul>
<li>29 said a clear ‘no’</li>
<li>11 did not respond</li>
<li>10 used a message dropping service and did not get back to us</li>
<li>One CEO wanted to meet (but we were unsure if he wanted to meet to get to know more people in the London tech scene or to become a customer). We are going to push for a sale in the meeting and see what happens.</li>
</ul>
<p>When evaluating the results we had a discussion about the companies in the ‘not answered’ and ‘using message leaving service’ categories. Were they in fact potential customers of ours?</p>
<h2 style="display: block !important"><a id="The_devil_is_in_the_data_30"></a>The devil is in the data</h2>
<p>We also looked into why people said no:</p>

</div>
<p>
Again, we had a discussion around whether some of the concerns could be mitigated over time. For example, if we proved that we were able to provide good quality support for  technical products, would someone in that market be happy to outsource support? Or would the low volume companies grow and consequently need our service one day?</p>
<p>HiOperator’s monthly traffic, available on SimilarWeb, suggests the company has not<br>
yet found strong product market fit.</p>

<h2><a id="The_hard_thing_about_hard_things_37"></a>The hard thing about hard things</h2>
<p>The decision was taken to pass on the idea (unless the meeting with the potential customer throws up something very interesting). This was a call we had to make with the hope of moving onto something with a clearer signal of immediate product market fit. Such a strong signal is not something I have experienced, but others in the team have, and they said this was not good enough.</p>
<p>But what do you think? I am genuinely curious about the answer. Would you have run this test? How might you have changed it? How would you have interpreted the results? What would you do next?</p>
<p>When you’re in a room together evaluating the results of an experiment you see the elements of art in calculated entrepreneurship. The questions of what test to run, what to do next and when to give up are important but often hard to define. No doubt they improve with experience and feedback, which is one of the reasons I wrote this post.</p>
