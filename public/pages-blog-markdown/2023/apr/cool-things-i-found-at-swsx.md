# 10 Cool things I found at SXSW 2023

Once again we found ourselves heading out to Austin Texas for the SXSW 2023 interactive, music and film festival. It’s our annual excursion to see the latest and greatest talks, devices, trends, music, BBQ and beer in the sun. If you haven’t been before it’s probably the best festival I’ve ever been to and this year had a full program and turnout after the previous limited post-pandemic attempt.

The schedule is absolutely insane, you really have to focus on the topics that are really important to you and take in as much as possible. So here are a few fun highlights I found from this years SXSW.

## 1. Amy Webb Launches 2023 Emerging Tech Trend Report


This talk was absolutely fascinating. Equal parts exciting and terrifying. [Amy Webb (Future Today)](https://amywebb.io/) focuses on the rapidly emerging technologies and the intersections between them in order to predict the changes they will make in our society.

The exec summary of the impact of various technologies on industry was summarised in this slide.

## 2.  The REAL lightsaber and characters in the disney parks talk.

Josh D'Amaro from Disney Parks lead the talk entitled [“The Art & Science of Disney Parks Storytelling”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqzLE4KjhI&ab_channel=DisneyParks) where he introduced various characters including a live holographic tinkabell, and a clumsy robotic Judy Hopps.

The most exciting moment though was when Josh was handed what appeared to be a [working prototype of a lightsaber!](https://youtu.be/4jBBoGSOKU0) No production details were released, but it looks amazing!

## 3.  New Media for the New Space Age

Tim Dodd (Everyday Astronaut), Jack Beyer (Nasa Spaceflight), Ryan Chylinski (Cosmic Perspective) and Jenny Hautmann (Supercluster) gave us a day in the life chasing space launches around the world. No sleep, not eating, the stress of pre-set cameras in restricted zones, it was interesting to hear how and why they do what they do.

## 4.  Move.ai iPhone body tracking app


We found Move.ai in #ukhouse representing the best of uk tech. It’s a body tracking app that works via 1 or more iphones to record your body motions, upload them to their servers and then apply that movement to any characters with 4 limbs in VR or gaming worlds.

Check out the results after processing, it's highly accurate! https://youtu.be/lON9D4XIA8k

Move.ai picked up a SXSW innovation award for this product, so congrats to them!

## 5.  AI T-shirt generation from Crowd


![AI generated image of a unicorn at disneyland](https://storage.googleapis.com/ssg-website-images/12%20Cool%20things%20I%20found%20at%20SXSW%202023/IMG_5276.JPG)
I met up with Jamie Sergeant from Crowd in the #ukhouse and he walked us through his t-shirt AI tech demo. Essentially they had built a booth were an AI asks you a few questions, then generates an image (interfaces via Dall-E2 ) and then sends it off to print via their client spreadshop which then gets delivered to your house after the show. Whilst the tech on display isn’t anything new, it’s the linking of the visuals in the booth, voice recognition, streamed into Dall-E and then into spreadshop in one seamless experience which was pretty cool. A nice implementation for a very happy client.

## 6.  Yamaha music table game

I spotted this cool music table game in the exhibition hall. It’s a decent concept, kinda like a directly competitive guitar hero. I can imagine playing this for a while in a bar or party.

## 7.  The Leia Lume pad 2.

These tablets were pretty impressive. Without the aid of glasses or other peripherals, they actually had a decent 3D capability. The stereo cameras on the front of the pad provide eye tracking, and also enable stereography, using a suite of Leia branded apps such as Leia Cam, Leia Player, Leia Tube, Leia Dream, Leia Pix, the Lume Tablet can convert both 2D images and video into 3D. You can’t really see it in the video I took, but trust me, it was very impressive.

## 8.  Netherhour recorded their latest track, “Doo Da Dee Da” at the latchkey one lazy sunny afternoon.

We found the [Latchkey bar](https://latchkeyatx.com/) on East 6th street after visiting the amazing [Zilker Brewery](https://zilkerbeer.com/?v=47e5dceea252). Netherhour happened to be playing in the backyard and were fantastic. A proper Austin band with original music. I wholey recommend them for some easy listening alongside a Zilker "Always Alright" ;-)

## 9.  Bird Buddy

No, not a wingman system, this nifty gadget is a bird feeder for the garden that takes photos and videos of your little visitors and uses AI to identify the breed, then pings a message to your phone along with the picture and some birdy information.

## 10.  This guy getting a taco on his horse
