So here I’m sitting at my desk a week after THE WHOLE COMPANY (apart from me) went to [SXSW](https://www.sxsw.com/).

It would be easy for me to be bitter, but **really** there is nothing quite as thrilling as working in the office nude, adjusting everyone’s monitor settings just a fraction, or raiding the ‘special client booze’ for a solo Thursday drinks. Yes, as you can tell I LOVED being the only one left behind.

And it’s not like they didn’t go and have a ball. After a full on year the team mixed *some* learning with a lot of ‘experiences’. I would call it bonding, but I’m not allowed, so let’s call it what it really is - arsing around in America while trying to find out ‘what’s new, and what’s new but a bit silly’. Usually with a beer in hand, it seems.

I asked the team for their insights on SXSW and the big ole’ US of A. This, folks, is how Solid State did Texas.

  and I would tend to agree with him. Here’s Toki - series 2 by Akinori Goto which uses 3d printing, projection and motion to explore time and space. More of this for next year please! - Niall

**So that was SXSW 2017 **- a random selection from me for a very random festival of tech, ideas, food and music. Until next year, when I hope they invite me. Aziz out.
