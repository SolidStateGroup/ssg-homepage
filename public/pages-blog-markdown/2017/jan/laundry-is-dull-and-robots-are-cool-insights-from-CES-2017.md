From IoT sex pants, to audio through your skull, last week’s Consumer Electronics Show did not hold back on the weird and wonderful new tech - but is any of it useful?

Overall there were no massive ground breaking advances, but there were some pretty amazing iterations on last years tech. These are my highlights.

## Home

CES is all about Audio and Video and the best TV on demo was the LG W7 wallpaper screen. Just over 3mm thick 77" OLED TV. Not just a concept, it's going on sale in the US in 2 weeks!

## Bone conduction

There were quite a few devices on show that played sound directly into your skull by vibrating against your cranium.

[SGNL](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sgnlstrap/sgnl-make-phone-calls-with-your-fingertip) is wristband that allows you to make calls via your fingertips just like the CIA. The sound was pretty muffled, but you could just about make out the voice.

The best of the bunch though was the [Batband](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ostrich-pillow/batband). The sound was crisp and clear. Not as good as normal headphones, but keeps your ears open for other audio. Perfect for an audio based cycling satnav etc.

## Cars

There were tons of cars, concepts, connections and in car entertainment. In fact in some cases, the audio made up the [majority of the car](https://goo.gl/photos/m8H2emQCyp2iN4Zi9).

For me, the best bits in the car area was the use of [holographic displays by BMW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD7J2t7D1jE). It has active feedback when you "press" the buttons floating in mid air. Madness!

Also the [Nissan electric drivers car](https://goo.gl/photos/z7a6ozGEPcVdPF5f9)[ (cheesy final fantasy style video here)](https://youtu.be/9zZ2h2MRCe0), and the concept cars by [VW](https://goo.gl/photos/vH3ySTKDHuD5RMWB7) and [Honda](https://goo.gl/photos/Znt865DMp1iorUNH9).

## Laundry

Right. Laundry is dull and robots are cool. So let’s get robots to do laundry! The 2 best systems at CES [Foldimate](https://goo.gl/photos/hjbVPPuEGYTpeWbN7) (they thought long and hard about that name) and [Laundroid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfeQT5oNQW4). Foldimate looks way faster but you need to manually feed all your clothes into the clips! Laundroid just goes through your pile of washing picking out each item which is way cooler. Although the laundroid system takes about 10 minutes to fold a t-shirt and in the current demo it looks so big it could be a small person housed inside folding t's.

## Bots

Bots! bots! everywhere! Everyone had a new personal friend to help in the home. Crazy examples are [this one by LG](https://goo.gl/photos/ESDZGipoMq5Nhjj36) which integrates with Alexa and lots of home automation systems, and [this one](https://goo.gl/photos/WxMUcFVv3Pt8rcZ57) by someone a little disturbed in China somewhere. LG also had more specific bots like this [airport cleaning unit](https://goo.gl/photos/KgFEss5eQ2CwwCqn7), which was pretty cool.

## Alexa

Voice was pretty big at the show. The Amazon echo didn't make an appearance, but Alexa (the voice system powering the echo) was everywhere. It was in the LG bots, in all the cars, in the fridges and pretty much all the IoT devices. Amazon’s early launch seems to have paid off and they are gaining ground on Google home, Siri et al for the moment.

## IoT & Health

The health and IoT area was immense! I walked around for about 3 hours and still had not finished the health area. Most of it was iterations on previous releases, but new and wonderful sensors are being devised every day. These were some of the new bits;

* [The first AI toothbrush](https://goo.gl/photos/eWnxVCfybbaHWDLX6)

* [The connected hairbrush](https://goo.gl/photos/niWKcxJjok1R4MHP8) from Loreal

* [The smartphone eye test kit](https://goo.gl/photos/8gMj9TkNWACDE2ux9) from EyeQue - I bought one of these because I think the trend of moving traditional high street services to home home testing and subscription model is quite interesting

* Lots of various blood pressure, heart rate, sweat, activity, sleep and other body function monitors

* Massively over engineered [massage chairs](https://goo.gl/photos/tAieBtHaxTBqCTZB6)

## And lastly … Wide World Weird

I love looking out for the bizarre stuff that comes from all over the world. This years WTF? prizes go to;

* [Connected tea cube](http://www.42tea.io/en/). It's a plastic cube that you connect to your phone via bluetooth. Then put it into the tea. It detects the type of tea your are making, looks up the optimal steeping time, then pings your phone when it's time to remove the bag. This has received an innovation award, but I'm putting this into the "over engineered" section. I guess if you love tea that much...

* [IoT sex Pants](https://goo.gl/photos/5jM27LpzxaEeCVY99) - yep, it's a thing now

* [Sexy screen headphones](https://goo.gl/photos/wXBJwSoy8jvEMqRDA) - no you can't make calls. It's just an iPod on both sides of the headphones. Apparently they are working on the battery life because the screens drain the power. They told me you can switch them off though… but then it would just be...

* [Water bottle bluetooth speaker](https://goo.gl/photos/bQEeVsG4XU9iMUsB6) - No, it doesn't measure water consumption or anything. It's just a bottle stuck to a bluetooth speaker with a magnetic phone holder...

Those were my highlights. CES is a great show and of course the nightlife is second to none in Vegas. If you want to see all my [CES photos, you can find them here](https://goo.gl/photos/FUo9mBcVZe4uL5kd8).
