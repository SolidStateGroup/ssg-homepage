We've written this blog for the entrepreneur who's raised some money and got themselves some investors and users with high expectations. The pressure is on to improve the first app, stablise it, mature it, and expand it.

React Native is fast becoming the tool of choice for app re-writes or app scale-ups, so we've put together some use cases to show you how React Native can be performant, stable and future-proof.

### Before we start:

1. Check out this blog [if you have no clue what React Native is](https://www.solidstategroup.com/2017/02/08/2017/Its-cross-platform-and-massively-reduces-app-dev-costs-but-WTF-is-React-Native/).
2. <a target="_blank" href="/2018/02/27/2018/From-MVPs-to-Raising-Seed-Money---Why-You-Should-Build-Your-App-in-React-Native/">Read this blog if you've not built your MVP yet nor alpha version of your app.</a>
3. <a href="/2018/02/28/2018/How-Do-I-Use-A-React-Native-App-To-Raise-A-Seed-Round/" target="_blank">And if you're trying to raise seed money, this is how you'd use React Native to impress investors.</a>

### How can I use React Native to future-proof my app re-write?

Startups like to move fast and break things. But then they get some dosh and suddenly they need to use words like reliability and consistency. It’s not terribly rock and roll, more... Ed Sheeran. Though, let’s face it, our Ed’s done pretty well.

At this point, scale-ups start to look at app re-writes and some pretty massive unicorns have used React Native for theirs. We picked out our [favourite startups which use React Native](https://www.solidstategroup.com/2017/10/25/2017/Startups-Who-Built-Apps-With-React-Native/), and they range from Uber to Facebook itself.

Surely if businesses of that calibre are putting their long term bets on React Native and trusting it to deliver quality code long term, then yours might be suitable too.

> But would I sacrifice deeper functionality for speed with React Native?

React Native is not just a skin overlaying the native functionality of the app. It's not just putting lipstick on a pig. It really is the whole sausage.

React Native Javascript is bundled application code which communicates with the native libraries and part of what we've done is test how well it can handle these integrations, specifically looking at whether [React Native can handle integrations](https://www.solidstategroup.com/2017/06/29/2017/Bridges-Over-Troubled-Water-can-React-Native-handle-integrations/) at a lower level of functionality. In our experience of React Native, 95% of the code is shared between android and iOS. That remaining 5% accesses deeper functionality in the phone and therefore we used bridges in Java or Swift to complete the development. The results were stable, and flexible, built for the future. 

Using React Native meant no compromise between functionality and speed.

And if you’re in doubt about whether React Native can save you development time when you need to push a major update swiftly, [we developed a sophisticated fantasy football app in just six months](https://www.solidstategroup.com/our-work/dugout-fc/), thanks to the time-saving React Native gave us.
