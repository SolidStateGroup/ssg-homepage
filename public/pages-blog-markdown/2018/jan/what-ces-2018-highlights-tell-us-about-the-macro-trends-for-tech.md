The world’s mightiest electronics companies swarmed into Las Vegas last week to show off their concepts and show ponies at CES. The desert of Nevada promptly dropped buckets of rain all over them, and the pinnacles of human achievement blinked into darkness and uselessness like a chocolate teapot on the moon.

Black Mirror has us all paranoid about robots overpowering us, but rest assured that a cup of water is still all we need to defeat our overlords. For now.

CES 2018 soon got its power back up and the spotlights were firmly on the TVs, but the new boys on the block with their tendrils in every area, the DUP of CES if you will, is voice activation. It’s in EVERYTHING from toilets to cars.

So I won’t bore you with 15 examples of Alexa in a BMW, instead, I'll tantalise your proverbial tastebuds with the really delicious products to salivate over. It’s only 340 days till Christmas!

#### The Wall

Not a WWE contender but a Samsung TV big enough to blot out the sun. It’s 146 inches long diagonally but the really important pieces of information are the buzzwords, AI and modular.

We’re used to seeing mind-blowing high definition TVs with such detail and colour that they’re a more pleasing visual experience than your own children, but The Wall doesn’t use extra LEDs to reach the new heights of definition. It uses AI to upscale standard definition content to 8K and adjust sound levels automatically for different content, such as sports events or music concerts. That’s right, content doesn’t need to be produced in 8K for you to view it in 8K.

The second buzzword is modular. The Wall is aiming to be the first modular tv, meaning customers can change the size and shape of the tv to suit their needs, and presumably companies can add extra features to sell too. Expect to see these ~~extra revenue streams~~ modular hardware entering the market.

#### Razer - Project Linda

Obviously we’re gamers in the office and we got very excited at [the future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYekvWXtMIs), but it’s Razer’s Project Linda that’s generated the real buzz this year.

Razer is a gaming peripherals company and they’ve taken their own gaming laptop, dug out the trackpad, and made a dock for their gaming phone. [The result is a laptop/smartphone hybrid](https://www.razerzone.com/projectlinda). The phone gets 200GB storage, a full sized keyboard, a webcam and a microphone. The laptop gets an intelligent trackpad, phone apps and extra screen. All designed for gaming. And entertainment. And creativity.

#### Ring by Enhancia

The award for "Super Nifty But Niche" goes to a ring Enhancia showcased. If a keyboard player wears the ring while playing the electric keyboard, they can [generate effects such as vibrato](https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/11/this-ring-lets-you-bend-musical-notes-on-a-keyboard-with-a-wave-of-your-hand/) or intensity. Enhancia’s not actually opened its kickstarter yet so it might end up on the pile of failed hardware startups, but, we really hope it doesn’t.

#### Somnox

"Clean eating", “meal replacement”, “mindfulness”, so 2017. The fad-follower of 2018 will be bragging about sleep. Yes, competitive sleeping is coming to an Instagrammer near you.

We’ve already got sleep trackers, smart mattresses and so on, but [the Somnox](https://www.somnox.nl/) is the next level: the Sleep Robot, billed as the world’s most huggable robot.

It should help you sleep better and faster, and even the website is relaxing, so I think we’ll be seeing more of these cuddly beans in 2018.

> > The consumer is taking charge of their own health - see our [healthcare tech trends series](https://www.solidstategroup.com/2017/11/30/2017/Healthcare-Tech-Trends-for-2018/) to see how prevention, emotional support, and early adoption are becoming the patient’s domain.

Somnox isn’t the only robot looking to provide humans with emotional care. This is another big trend at CES.

#### Aibo

I hate robot dogs on sight. They’re gimmicky, fake and usually end up at the back of a wardrobe after a few weeks once their limited range of abilities is exhausted. This robot is a big step forward however, and everyone’s obsessed with it so I’ll grudgingly admit it deserves a few words here. [Aibo’s new features include expressive eyes and much more intelligence](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/11/16876086/sony-aibo-hands-on-video-ces-2018). Aibo will even learn which family members interact with it the most, and spend more time with them in return.

So now you can be jealous of a robot too.

#### Aflac Duck

I’m warming more to the Aflac duck, not just because it’s fluffy but because it’s already making a real difference to a big issue: children with cancer. At a show filled with smart incense dispensers and £500 light triangles, it’s back down to earth with a bump.

This smart toy comforts children in hospital environments, helps them communicate their emotions, and encourages them to play. There’s a [video to watch here](https://aflacchildhoodcancer.org/), you might need some tissues at hand.

So modular hardware, voice-activated-everything, emotional robots, healthcare tech, gamer peripherals. Pick a trend and get jumping.
